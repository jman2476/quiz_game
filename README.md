## Description
This quiz game is designed to test your knowledge of basic JavaScript concepts. It involves 10 questions, and you have one minute to answer the questions. If you answer a question correct, you get a point, and if you answer a question wrong, you lose 10 seconds of your time. At the end, your score (time remaining) and your points are shown to you, with the option to save your score. When you save the score, you will be taken to the high scores page.

## Usage
To use this quiz, click on the 'start quiz' button, and you will be taken directly to the first question with a countdown on the upper right side. After answering the question, you will be shown the next question, as well as an alert that tells you if you got the previous question correct or incorrect, and there will be a one second pause where you cannot click the next button. This is so that you read the next question and don't accidently just click through all of them, like I definitely would.

## Tests
To  verify the application is working as intended, here are a few tests you can run:

-When the timer runs out, the quiz should end and show you your score
-When you have answered 10 questions before the time runs out, the quiz should end and show you your score
-When you type in your initials and hit the save button, you should be taken to the high scores page, and shown a list of all saved scores done on that browser
-When you reopen the browser after closing, the old scores should still be there
-When you view the list of scores, they should be listed in order of score, not points
